# ANTLR + Visual Studio Example
## Summary
This project assumes that:

* You have ANTLR 4 installed,
* You have a general understanding of what ANTLR is as well as how to use it outside of the context of Visual Studio, and
* You have installed the [ANTLR Language Support](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/25b991db-befd-441b-b23b-bb5f8d07ee9f) extension for Visual Studio

The solution contains two projects:

* Grammar Definition (Konves.Examples.Antlr.Grammar)
* Generated C# Parser (Konves.Examples.Antlr)

## Grammar Definition
This project contains only the grammar definition file (*.g4).  The ANTLR Language Support
adds a build target to the .proj file that runs ANTLR.  The C# artifacts end up in the
`/obj/` folder and a post build task copies them to the Generated C# Parser project.

## Generated C# Parser
This project contains the code files generated by ANTLR.  The build output can then be
consumed by other projects.
